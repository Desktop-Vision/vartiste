# Interface Overview

The VARTISTE interface is mainly divided into 3 sections:

  1. The canvas and model (straight ahead by default)
  2. The settings and controls on the left
  3. The layers and nodes on the right

The main UI components are:

  - Shelves, which mainly contain a lot of buttons
  - Buttons
  - Edit Fields
  - Canvases

UI components can be clicked by pointing at them and using the primary trigger
or mouse button. Most components can also be grabbed and moved using the
controller's grab control (e.g., the grab trigger on Rift Touch controllers, or
squeezing the grip on the Valve Index).

# Drawing Tutorials

## Sketching Practice

Sketching with VARTISTE can be pretty fun and roughly approximate sketching with
pencil and paper. This tutorial will go over importing reference photos,
arranging your workspace, and drawing with the 6-DOF detail pencil.

### Import your reference photo(s)

It's always helpful to have references to sketch from. I'm going to use [this
picture of a dog (Photo by Garfield Besa from
Pexels)](https://www.pexels.com/photo/shallow-focus-photography-of-a-golden-retriever-686094/),
but you can use whatever images you want.

The first step is to turn on the Refernce Toggle ![Reference
Toggle](../assets/badge-account-horizontal-outline.png) button on the settings
shelf. Then simply drag and drop your image onto the VARTISTE browser window. I
find it easier to do this step before entering VR, personally.

at any time.

The 6 degree-of-freedom tools are tools that are intended to be grabbed and
moved around
