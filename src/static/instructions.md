# VARTISTE

<img src="../assets/vartiste.png" class="logo">

Pronounced Vee-Ar-tEEst. VARTISTE is a virtual reality app for 2D drawing and
image editing. A virtual reality headset with tracked motion controllers, such
as the [Valve Index](https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex) or
[Oculus Rift S](https://www.oculus.com/rift-s/) is required to use it.

## Saving and loading

Use the "File" ![File](../assets/floppy.png) icon to save to a VARTISTE project file. You'll need to take off
your VR headset and click the download button from your browser. This will save
all of the layers in the image.

To load a VARTISTE file, drag and drop it onto the browser window where VARTISTE
is running. **NOTE: This will replace your currently active scene.**

**NOTE: Saving and loading is currently very wonky. Make lots of backup saves.**

To save a PNG, click the "Camera" ![Camera](../assets/camera.png) icon. You'll need to take off your VR headset
and click the download button from your browser.

_You cannot currently import images aside from the VARTISTE project file. I'm
working on that._
