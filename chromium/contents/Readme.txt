VARTISTE Download Version
-------------------------

## Overview

This archive contains a build of Chromium from the Chromium Developers which
has been rebranded with a VARTISTE icon. It also contains a fixed version of the
VARTISTE application. Finally, there is a little launcher which will start a web
server on port 7806 to serve the application files, and launch the bundled
Chromium with flags for OpenXR.

_Note:_ Although all of the VARTISTE application files are included in this
package, some external resources will still be fetched from the internet, and
the application may not work correctly if no internet connection is available.

_Note:_ Some functionality is tied to the https://vartiste.xyz domain, and may
not work correctly when running the local version from the PC.

## Running

 1. Double Click `vartiste-launcher.exe`
 2. Accept any security warnings (**WARNING** The bundled version of Chromium
    does _not_ auto-update. Do not use it to open any files from untrusted
    sources. Do not use it for general purpose web browsing.)
 3. Select either the button for "Launch From PC", which will use the downloaded
    application files; or "Launch VARTISTE Online", which will direct the
    browser to https://vartiste.xyz, and use the latest up-to-date version of
    VARTISTE
